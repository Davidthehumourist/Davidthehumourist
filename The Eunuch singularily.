- 👋 Hi, I’m @Davidthehumourist
- 👀 I’m interested in sound doctrinal ministry to honor the Messiah in what He established for a sinful man like me living toward righteousness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what it woikd take to persuade a woman to be with me according to sound doctrine. Prior to that I have to say its an honor to preach the Gospel for souls to be saved. Onky Christians enter Heaven.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on no one except with a woman sound doctrinally.
- 📫 How to reach me my social medias are evidently known. Why no woman contacts me? Only Jesus knows.
